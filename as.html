  <br>

<p>Junior year is here and it's time to take the ACT or SAT.
The ACTs and SATs are exams you have to take to get into a college;
most colleges require one of these test scores as a part of the application,
but you don't have to take both--
you can convert an ACT score to SAT and vice versa.
This exam can determine what kind of college/university you attend,
how much money you can get off your tuition (if you earn a high score),
and what kind of classes you will be taking the following year. </p>

<p>In order to get a good score on these tests,
you will have to practice.
Everyone wants an excellent score, but it all depends on you--
you have to work and put in the effort;
you will need to practice as much as you can because practice makes perfect.
We would highly encourage you to use any SAT or ACT practice materials that your school can offer;
some libraries have the test prep books from Princeton Review or Barron's; there are also numerous websites online.</p>

 <p>We would also suggest finding other resources like ACT or SAT programs that will help you practice and
 teach you something if you don't know how to do it.
 These tests are designed to be tricky, and with practice, you can start seeing what the exam writers want to test you on and
 how to go about those questions.
 Oftentimes, students make the process much more difficult that it can be--
 specific test resources can help you find accurate shortcuts.
 We would suggest going to your closest public library or to a bookstore to buy an ACT or SAT prep book to help you practice at home.
 There are also websites that will provide free examples of previous ACT or SAT exams that you can use to take and
 know what you still need to work on.
 In addition, if you have taken the SAT before, you can link your CollegeBoard account to Khan Academy,
 and they will devise a study plan complete with exams and sets of practice questions that are tailored to your needs.</p>
