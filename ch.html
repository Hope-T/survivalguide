<p> My name is Char’lesia Hughes I am 16 years old and I am from Chicago. I attend The Noble Academy, a charter school, so we have a lot of rules and regulations that must be followed and a strong disciplinary culture. I come from a big family. I have five siblings on my mom side and six on my dad side of the family.I have done cheerleading for 2 years and counting and step for 8 years. My zodiac sign is a libra. I love sports/clubs that involves or builds a sisterhood because I love it when other women power one another and supports them.
I remember my sophomore year I tried to balance school while also doing cheerleading and maintaining a job. There was several times when I would go home crying because the pressure was too much. Then one day I came to school and my eyes were puffy and red and my advisor asked me, “Char’lesia what’s wrong?” I didn’t know what to say, so I broke down and said, “I can’t do it, but I can’t let them down,” at this point she began to cry and told me to tell her everything. I finally told her everything and it felt like a big burden had been lifted off of me. I then realized that I thought I knew how to balance school, personal life, and a job, but I really didn’t and that was okay because I was just a sophomore at the time.
