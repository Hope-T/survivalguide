  <p><font size="5"> Sophomore year is very difficult because
you think you have the rhythm of balancing classes and social life.
It’s also difficult because you're not as excited about the school
since you have already experienced it. Sophomore year might make you
feel lost and out of place. This year can also make you question
yourself; this is called “Sophomore Slump”. It is perfectly fine to
go into Sophomore year expecting that you will be so organized, balanced,
and prepared. However, it has been a while since you went through
freshman year. Keep in mind that every year is different and
therefore requires different skills and preparation.</font></p>

<h3 style="font-family:arial;">What to Expect out of Slump Year</h3>

<p><font size="5"> During SLump Year you often feel the need to give up on work. You are at that year where
you are no longer the "baby" of the school nor are you the eldest either.
During Slum Year, you start to notice your grades dropping. You are no longer
as excited as you were freshmen year. Your group of friends are dwindling.
Everything seems to be at a stand still.
-----All these feelings are normal;however,there are many ways
to avoid Slump year</font></p>

<p><font size="5">During Sophomore slump students should try to get in
  touch with their feeling, fight through it. Mental Health is very
  important sophomore year. Take the time out of your day to check in
  with yourself. Ask yourself; "Am I Happy","Am I getting enough sleep",
"What can I do to better myself?".</font></p>
