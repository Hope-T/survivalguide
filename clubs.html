<p style="font-family:arial;">In high school, clubs are a vital part of the social scene;
  they bring people with the same interests together,
  and provide a recreational space outside of strict academics and grades.
  They're not mandatory, but are a good stepping stone to a successful integration into high school.
  In addition, if you want to be a competitive applicant to colleges, clubs show that you are involved and that you're not just a name with a set of grades.
  In America, being involved is incredibly important.
  In addition, clubs can give you leadership positions; they can also help you stand out (as test scores are just one factor in the college decision process).
  Actually, many people have the same grades and test scores as you; your essays, clubs, job positions, and/or volunteer hours are what help you distinguish yourself from all the other applicants!
  With that said, let's get started!</p>

  <h3 style="font-family:arial;">More Into Clubs at High Schools</h3>
  <p>Joining extra curricular activities is not only a great way to have fun, but also a way to meet new friends;
    most importantly, it will be very useful when you are applying to colleges (though that may seem like a long time away).
    Going back to the topic of meeting new people (and possibly making new friends):
    it will help you socialize with others who might not go to the same classes as you or who may not even be in your grade level.</p>

<p>While considering what kind of clubs and activities you would like to join, take in mind that this is a new beginning and you should want to try something you would have never imagined you would do but that still sounds interesting.
  Don’t be scared to try something new.
  If you already know what you would like to join, go for it!
  That’s excellent as well.
  However, if you get to high school and you don’t know what to do, look at all the programs, clubs, and sports they offer and choose the one that most interests you.
  It never hurts to try!</p>

<p>Another really great benefit you would get out of being in a club would be the fact that it will be a great thing to put down in your application when you are applying to colleges.
  Colleges want to see that you are well rounded student (a well rounded student is an applicant who is not only dedicated to their school work, but who is also dedicated to their extracurricular activities).
  If you are involved in any sort of activity, you will learn new skills like communication skills, networking skills, team cooperation skills, leadership skills, etc.
  Colleges also want to know that you are able to manage your time;
  they want to see that you are able to succeed in their school while still being able to have fun.
  What do you have to offer to them?
  What new perspectives or hobbies will you bring to the table?
  How will you impact their diversity?
  It will also show that intelligence is not the only skill you can bring to the table.
  Being involved will show everyone that you are enthusiastic in life, which is great!</p>

<p>In addition, the people who are organizing these activities will most likely be willing to give you a recommendation for colleges, internships, honor society organizations, and the like.
  When you are in an extracurricular activity, you get to network with people, which will help you in the future;
  connections and being able to form them are incredibly important in the real world!
