  <h1 style="font-family:arial; text-color:white;">Transitioning from Middle School to High School</h1>
  


    <p style="font-family:arial;">In middle school, you're at the top of the chain, but in high school, you're at the bottom, once again.
      Grades and classes are more important than ever, and while college seems so far away, it's going to be here in a short blink of an eye;
      now is not the time to get distracted or confused!
      A complete education is incredibly important nowadays, and anybody can graduate high school as long as you stay dedicated to your coursework and remember why you're here.
      You are here to learn, to gain knowledge, to expand your mind!
      Honestly, your high school may suck, but a good transcript is your ticket out of there.
      The easiest path to a good transcript is an excellent start;
      if you start high school unafraid and ready to go, you're one step closer to achieving your goals!
      In this section of HSG, we'll help you transition from middle school to high school.</p>
<br>
  <h3 style="font-family:arial">All About Transitioning</h3>

  <p style="font-family:arial;">Going to high school while coming out of junior high is exciting yet terrifying to most students.
        High school is a step up to having more liberty and freedom, but that leads to knowing that means more responsibility.
        There will be more opportunities and choices now that you are getting older like jobs, extracurricular activities, and being able to pick your new friend groups. </p>

<p style="font-family:arial;"> While transitioning from grammar school to high school, you will need to adapt to a new building, know where things are, make new friends, take new, more difficult courses, be more conscious about yourself, your surroundings, and what you want (for example, you'll need to navigate through peer pressure, think about your future and where you want to be in ten years; you'll also be exposed to more diversity), challenge yourself to meet new expectations, and get to know new teachers.
  You will also have to face the fact that there will be new contradictory and provocative issues available to you, like drugs and alcohol and the idea of having sex. Going from a junior high school to high school is a giant leap for everyone. </p>

<p style="font-family:arial;">Peer pressure occurs more during high school because everyone wants to experience new things, especially because they are now available to them.
  If you ever feel peer pressure, talk to someone around you, such as a counselor, a teacher, a doctor or therapist, your parents, and your friends.
  They are there to help you through high school and if you don't feel comfortable with any of these people, there are also help hotlines that will allow you to talk anonymously to them.
  Before you enter high school, you should prioritize what your values are and remind yourself what't important to you; hold yourself to those standards, and strive to stay with people who won't pressure you to do otherwise.</p>

<p style="font-family:arial;">Junior high school teachers and high school teachers are quite different;
they all have different goals for you--what's notably different is the fact that high school teachers are there to push you so that you will be prepared for college.
High school teachers will have higher academic expectations, and these teachers want to help you go to the best college possible;
however, they will want you to do the hard work yourself and vastly improve through the year.
At first, high school will seem rather scary but at the end of the day you will be able to appreciate your high school experiences. </p>

<br>
<h3 style="font-family:arial;">Before You Start Freshmen Year</h3>
<p>Know what your values are; develop a "moral code" that you will stand by.</p>
<p>Write up a list of what you'll abide by once the school year starts.</p>


<br>

<h3 style="font-family:arial;">During High School</h3>
<p>Try to maintain close relationships with people who have the same moral code.</p>
  <p>You can still be friends with people who have different values, but just make sure that you still have friends who will keep you on the path you want to be on!</p>
  <p>If you ever feel uncomfortable about anything, talk with someone about it, whether that person is someone you know or a help hotline or even someone online.</p>
