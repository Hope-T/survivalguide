<h1>BERENICE PEREZ</h1>
<p>My name is Berenice Perez.
  I go to De La Salle Institute, and I am a rising junior.
  I;m part of the National Honors Society, and have all honors classes.
  I am Mexican; I love to play soccer and go swimming.
  I live in Chicago.
  I attended the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program this summer (summer 2017).
  I will be the 1st generation of my family who will be attending to college.
  My years of high school so far have been a success; I always have ended with 4.0 or more GPA.</p>
<p>During these two years of high school, I went through a lot of experiences and I often learned something new or was reminded of the same lesson again.
  One experience I love to share is when I got an A in my biology class.
  This story takes place 2 weeks before finals.
  Biology was always my hardest subject, and because it was my hardest subject, I had to work harder and study harder than any other subject.
   Of course I worked my hardest in other classes as well, but that class was the one I took more time on to understand and comprehend.
   I would always go before school and ask questions or ask him if he would be able to help me study more for the quiz or test we had that day.
   If I saw the opportunity for extra credit, I would take it and do it.
   My grade for the end of the class was a 92.8; I was so devastated because I didn’t end with a 93.0 which is an A.</p>

   <p>My only hope was to get an A in my final, but I was about to give up.
    But I told myself, "Don’t give up just yet, you still need finals."
  So I studied those two weeks before finals so I would pass it with an A.
  I got help from the teacher himself and tutors from my scholarship; I looked over all my notes and my powerpoints and retaught myself.
  I was so scared I wasn’t going to be able to end with an A, but when I got my report card, I got an A in the class after all.
  I started to cry and pray.
  When I got back to school, I asked my teacher how I got an A,
   and he said that even with my extra credit, I wouldn’t be able to get an A, so he put more extra credit than I did.
   I asked him why he did that, and he told me, “Berenice, I don’t grade only based on your scores.
    I want my students to try their hardest and you did.
    I decide what grade I give you, and you came to me when you needed help or wanted to go over the lecture again.
    So, I put more extra credit for you.”</p>

<p>My advice for you guys is to never give up, no matter how much you want to;
   instead find a motivation not to give up.
   Also, ask for help from your teachers and create a good relationship with your teachers because they will help you when you need them.</p>
